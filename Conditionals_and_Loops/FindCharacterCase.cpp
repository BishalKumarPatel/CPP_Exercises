/*  
Problem statement
Write a program that takes a character as input and prints either 1, 0, or -1 according to the following rules.

1, if the character is an uppercase alphabet (A - Z)
0, if the character is a lowercase alphabet (a - z)
-1, if the character is not an alphabet

Constraints :
Input can be any character.
Constraints :
Input can be any character.
Input format :
The only line of input contains a single character.
Output format :
The only line of output prints eith1, 0 or -1(as applicable).
Sample Input 1 :
v
Sample Output 1 :
0
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
v is a lower case alphabet hence the output is 0.
Sample Input 2 :
V
Sample Output 2 :
1
Explanation of Sample Input 3:
V is an upper case alphabet hence the output is 1.
Sample Input 3 :
#
Sample Output 3 :
-1
Explanation of Sample Input 3:
# is a symbol and neither an upper case alphabet nor lower case alphabet; hence the output is -1.
